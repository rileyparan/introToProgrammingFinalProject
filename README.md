Tetris - Riley Paran 
## Description

I will be creating a Tetris game. The game will incorporate blocks and the controller has the free will to place them wherever they please. The blocks will be color coordinated and disappear once there is a certain amonunt of blocks on the base level. 

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

* All programs downloaded 
* Pygame and Python 

### Installing

* Programs and folders/files already downloaded 

### Executing program

* randomly place blocks at the top (import random)
* player is the controller of where the blocks go 
* blocks will have to occupy full level in order to disappear 
    * keep racking up points each level you make diasppear 
```
* code blocks for commands
* (import random)
* (import pygame)
```

## Help

* blocks disappearing after hitting a certain amount 
* putting certain lines of code in the right places in order to work
* make the blocks not one block as they collide, not intersect
* making the blocks not go pass the ground floor 

*
```
```
